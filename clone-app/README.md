NOTE:
The application is partial clone of a movie vending website found on the following URL-https://moviesanywhere.com/welcome. Some subtle changes were made to background color. 

The website was dissected on the following figma page -  https://www.figma.com/file/uplvX8y4YXwo797ULUlATl/Cloned-Movie-App-dissecting?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=JQ2RZWFVTjGkIRNZ-0

Four components were generated from the dissection and produced using React and TailwindCss styling.

A Moviedata component was also created outside the src folder containing an array of objects storing the data to display a list of popular movies on the MovieList component.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
